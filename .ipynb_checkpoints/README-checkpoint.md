# week14_deep_learning_project
Use Deep Learning NN to model Bitcoin closing prices:
- Historical closing prices
- Fear and Greed Index

## Data preparation
Historical closing prices/ Fear and Greed Index
- 70% training, 30% testing (each)
- Apply MinMaxScaler
- Reshape X_train, X_test

## Build and train custom LSTM RNN
Historical closing prices/ Fear and Greed Index

- Create the same custom LSTM RNN arch. Same parameters

## Evaluate performance
- Which has lower loss
- Which is better at tracking values?
- Best window size
